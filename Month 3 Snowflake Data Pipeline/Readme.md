ðŸ”¹ Week 1 â€“ Snowflake + Staging from Python
Goal: Learn to load data into Snowflake manually and then programmatically.

âœ… Set up your Snowflake trial account.

ðŸ”¹ Load CSV data using SnowSQL CLI or Snowflake UI.

ðŸ”¹ Connect to Snowflake using Python (e.g., snowflake-connector-python).

ðŸ”¹ Write a Python function to upload Bronze/Silver CSVs to Snowflake staging tables.

ðŸ§  Learn how Snowflake handles storage and compute (WAREHOUSES, DATABASES, SCHEMAS).

ðŸ”¹ Week 2 â€“ Data Modeling + dbt Core (Locally)
Goal: Build dimensional models and transform raw data with dbt.

ðŸ”¹ Set up dbt Core locally and connect it to your Snowflake project.

ðŸ”¹ Build your first dbt models (stg_customers, stg_claims, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Use Jinja templating, variables, and dbt run, dbt test, dbt docs.

ðŸ”¹ Learn best practices: naming conventions, staging â†’ marts structure.

ðŸ§  Understand slowly changing dimensions (SCD), incremental models.

ðŸ”¹ Week 3 â€“ dbt Incremental + Testing
Goal: Move from full-refresh to incremental loading.

ðŸ”¹ Convert models to incremental (is_incremental()).

ðŸ”¹ Write basic tests (e.g., uniqueness, not null).

ðŸ”¹ Use dbt seeds to simulate lookup/reference tables.

ðŸ”¹ Learn the tradeoffs of full vs incremental and idempotency.

ðŸ§  Learn how to document models and generate dbt docs.

ðŸ”¹ Week 4 â€“ End-to-End Project + Deployment Prep
Goal: Bring it all together in a repeatable, scalable pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ Automate local pipeline: Extract â†’ Upload to Snowflake â†’ dbt Run.

ðŸ”¹ Introduce lightweight orchestration (bash script or Python orchestration).

ðŸ”¹ Optional: Try setting up dbt Cloud or GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

ðŸ”¹ Write README and prep this as a portfolio project.
